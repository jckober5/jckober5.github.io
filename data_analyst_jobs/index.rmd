# Summary

![](data_analyst_jobs.PNG)

After graduating Brigham Young University in 2017 with a degree in Statisitics I have pursued a career in Data Analytics. In 2020 to continue my pursuit, I graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with a degree in Data Analysis. I've worked in several smaller companies performing data analysis tasks and have moved into a career now where I feel comfortable and knowledgeable in this field.

As I look to my future and what my goals are for the future I've been tasked with the question on what do I need to build upon to grow in my career. One example is what do I need to accomplish to become a Senior in my field.

The primary objective of this project I've done is to evaluate the distinct skill sets and experiences that differentiate a Senior Data Analyst from a Data Analyst. By examining various facets such as technical proficiencies and experience levels, I aim to construct a unique view of the skill and experience needed towards seniority in data analysis roles.

With this project I have gathered Data Analyst job postings from Google using SerpAPI and Python. After that I've been able to model and format the data within a view in SQL so that it can be easily read and used within Tableau. Here I want to perform a simple, but powerful analysis on the following...

-   What programming language is in larger demand? (R vs Python vs SQL)

-   What BI platform is in larger demand? (Tableau vs Power BI vs Looker)

-   What are the qualifications to be hired as a Senior Data Analyst?

    -   Years of Experience

    -   Education Level

    -   Required Skills

The project aims to provide a robust comparative analysis of the skills and experiences necessary for transitioning from a Data Analyst to a Senior Data Analyst. The outcomes will serve as a valuable guide for aspiring data professionals, like myself, seeking to structure career development paths in the realm of data analysis. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a better understanding of the evolving career path for Data Analysis and the critical factors that underpin career progression in this dynamic field.
